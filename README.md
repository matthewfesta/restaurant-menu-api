Restaurant Menu API

For this test, we would like you to make an API to provide data to a restaurant menu application. This API should use nodeJS and GraphGL. It should include a README with instructions to run this API locally. We would love to see automated tests. Overall, we're trying to see your skill in node development. The rules beyond this are relatively simple. You can use as much or as little of the technology above as you'd like, but please use node. We are trying to gauge how you think about a problem and the cleanliness of your code. You may spend as much or as little time as you'd like on the project, however we do not ask for any more than an hour or 2. You may use any resources you'd like (google, stackoverflow, books, articles) but please make the code your own.

When you are done, please upload the resulting node application to a public GitHub repo. Please include a README with instructions to run your application locally. Feel free to add any notes on special procedures to run the code, and any notes about what you did and why.

Below you will find unstructured menu data for you to use:
